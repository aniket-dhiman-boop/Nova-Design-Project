## 🧠 Interview Preparation Notes
1. **What are media queries?**  
   Media queries are CSS techniques that allow webpages to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

2. **Explain mobile-first vs desktop-first design.**  
   - *Mobile-first*: Start styling for small screens and scale up.  
   - *Desktop-first*: Start with large screens and add media queries for smaller ones.

3. **How do you test responsiveness?**  
   By resizing the browser window or using Chrome DevTools’ device simulator.

4. **What CSS units are best for responsiveness?**  
   - `em`, `rem`, `%`, `vh`, and `vw` units are most flexible for modern layouts.
